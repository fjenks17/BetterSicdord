# Better Sicdord

Because the discord visual rework is ass.

The goal here was to mix the old ui with what I assume the ui team was going for in a way that doesn't cause physical pain to the users. I had been doing it in the quickCss editor, but I'm sick of having to send it to other people, and this is way easier.

There are bugs that I may or may not fix eventually, but I have a day job that sometimes is a day/night job. If you, the reader, wants to fix them, please do. **If you ask me to fix something, I will make it worse.**

Thanks for your support.

Disclaimer: I ripped a lot of this from [OldCord](https://github.com/milbits/oldcord). Definitely go check that out if you miss the 2020 layout, I just wanted to cherry pick some of the stuff from there and make some tweaks.
